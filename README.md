## Minimal TypeScript React app trying to use Auth0

I noticed Auth0 has published a module that seems intended for SPAs to work with Auth0 logon services.

I'm not sure why but right now this module seems to require 3rd party cookies to be enabled.

TODO: Find out if [refresh token rotation](https://auth0.com/blog/securing-single-page-applications-with-refresh-token-rotation/) will help with this?
